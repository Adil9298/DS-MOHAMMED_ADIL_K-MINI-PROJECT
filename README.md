# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bike Rental Demand Prediction and Anomaly Detection

This project builds machine learning models to predict bike rental demand using daily and hourly historical data based on environmental and seasonal factors. It also explores anomaly detection by identifying days with unusual rental patterns, potentially linked to external events (e.g., Hurricane Sandy).

## üìå Objective

To predict the number of bikes rented using machine learning models trained on weather, season, and temporal data, and detect anomalies caused by significant events.

| Feature       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `dteday`      | Date |
| `season`      | 1: Spring, 2: Summer, 3: Fall, 4: Winter |
| `yr`          | 0: 2011, 1: 2012 |
| `mnth`        | Month |
| `hr`          | Hour *(hourly data only)* |
| `holiday`     | Is holiday (1: Yes) |
| `weekday`     | Day of week (0: Sunday) |
| `workingday`  | Is working day |
| `weathersit`  | Weather condition |
| `temp`        | Normalized temperature |
| `atemp`       | Normalized "feels like" temperature |
| `hum`         | Normalized humidity |
| `windspeed`   | Normalized wind speed |
| `casual`      | Count of casual users *(dropped for modeling)* |
| `registered`  | Count of registered users *(dropped for modeling)* |
| `cnt`         | Total count of rentals (target) |

## üîç Project Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Import and inspect daily/hourly datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, handle duplicates, outliers, skewness.
3. **EDA**: Visualizations, correlation analysis.
4. **Feature Engineering**: One-hot encoding, new features (e.g., weekend flag).
5. **Model Training**: Apply various ML algorithms for regression/classification.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV for model optimization.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Compare models using R¬≤, RMSE, etc.
8. **Model Saving**: Save best model using `joblib`.
9. **Deployment (optional)**: Package model with FastAPI & Docker.
